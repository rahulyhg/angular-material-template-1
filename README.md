# Template Project Based On Angular Material

This is a template projecct based on angular material framework.  It employs components such as tabs, toolbars, and whiteframe.

<br/>

The non-angular components include the flex model, typography, and video libraries.

This project is meant as a UI frontend skeleton, therefore it does not call to any backend.  This makes it decoupled from a backend api.

However to keep with the angular framework, all the data is sucked in from services that return promises.  This is meant to behave as
close to API calls as possible.
